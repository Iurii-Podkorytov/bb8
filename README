# 🤖 BB-8 Inspired Spherical Companion Robot
---

## 🔍 Overview  
This project implements an autonomous spherical robot inspired by BB-8, combining **hamster drive mechanics** (an internal differential-drive robot propelling an outer sphere) and a **2-DOF revolute "neck"** for LiDAR/camera orientation. Our goal is to design a system integrating computer vision, hardware control, and motion planning to enable autonomous navigation and user interaction.

The repository is split into two branches:  
- **Simulation**: Gazebo environment for testing control algorithms.  
- **Hardware**: Implementation for a physical prototype.

## ⚙️ Features  
- **Hamster Drive**: Internal differential-drive system for stable, collision-resilient motion  
- **2-DOF Neck**: Tilt/swivel head mechanism for dynamic sensor orientation 
- **ROS2 NAV2 Stack**: SLAM, path planning, and obstacle avoidance

## 🧪 Simulation  
### Dependencies  
- ROS2 packages: 

### Usage  
1. Build a map:
   ```bash  
   ros2 launch bb8_bringup mapping.launch.py
   ```  
2. Launch navigation to a goal on a pre-built map: 
   ```bash  
   ros2 launch bb8_bringup navigation.launch.py
   ```  
3. Follow a target:  
   ```bash  
    ros2 launch bb8_bringup follower.launch.py
   ```
